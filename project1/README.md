# Project Description

- Implement the self-organizing map model of receptive field formation proposed by Goodhill (1993). Show that it can reproduce retinotopy and ocular dominance stripes.
- One of the important predictions of this model was that decreasing the correlation between inputs from different eyes (as in strabismus) should increase the spacing of ocular dominance stripes. Simulate this and discuss the experimental test by Löwel (1994).
- What happens in the model if one eye is deprived of input? How does this relate to the experimental finding that monocular deprivation induces a shift in ocular dominance towards the non-deprived eye (e.g., Wiesel & Hubel, 1963)?
- Discuss the broader implications of topographic self-organization for representations in the brain. Can the same principles be used to explain topography beyond primary visual cortex (Doshi & Konkle, 2023)? [You don’t need to simulate anything for this part, just briefly discuss the general ideas.]
